To implement the custom actions you've described for your GPT, we need to follow these steps:

Step 2: Configure the GPT with Custom Actions
Access GPT Configuration: Log in to the OpenAI platform and navigate to the GPT configuration section.
Add Custom Actions: In the configuration, add the custom actions for the "Github File Lister" and "Github File Reader". You'll need to fill in the details based on the schemas you've provided.
Step 3: Define Custom Action Schemas
Github File Lister Schema:

This schema allows the GPT to list the contents of directories in a GitHub repository.
It will use the endpoint https://api.github.com/repos/{owner}/{repo}/contents/{path}.
The parameters include owner, repo, and path.
The action will retrieve file information but not the file content itself.
Github File Reader Schema:

This schema enables the GPT to read the contents of a file from a GitHub repository.
The endpoint for this action is https://raw.githubusercontent.com/{owner}/{repo}/{branch}/{filepath}.
Parameters include owner, repo, branch, and filepath.
It's designed to be used in conjunction with the "Github File Lister" for complete file access.
Step 4: Intermediate Service (Optional)
While the schemas define how the GPT interacts with GitHub, you might still need an intermediate service if the GPT environment restricts direct API calls.
This service would handle the API requests to GitHub and then communicate the results back to the GPT.
Final Steps:
After setting up these actions in the GPT configuration, test them to ensure they work as expected.
Ensure that the security measures for handling the API key are robust, especially when accessing private repositories.
This setup would allow your GPT to interact with your GitHub repositories, listing directory contents and reading file data as per your requirements. Remember, while I can guide you through the process, the actual implementation and testing need to be done in your environment where you have access to the OpenAI platform and your GitHub repositories.
